# WIP

Python 3 only. If running Pyhton 2 (default for Mac OS X), you will need to install Python 3 somehow.
To run it, 

1. Open Terminal (or other commandline tool)
2. Go to the directory where the files are
3. Run the server by the following in commandline:

```bash
python HttpServer.py
```

# _formPost.html

This is a test of saving files. Files are saved as `participantN.css` under `results` folder. 
Currently, the file is overwritten every instance. It will be done by a Javascript for each participant (one file per particpant).


# TODO 

- Need to work out a way to make Pukar's app with one page app, or use the form to make the submit communicate with the server. I'd prefer to explore the first option first.
